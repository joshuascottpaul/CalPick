## Required
FileMaker Pro 16 or above

## Installation
Download both FMP12 files, open Card-Cal and look at the read-me script

## Hosting
The CardDatePicker file can be hosted so it can be available to all you solutions if required, make sure you edit scripts as outlined in the read-me

## Running
See example scripts in Card-Cal file<br />
Has some beauty on iOS as the layout doesn't move like when using the native picker<br />
Not currently tested on WebDirect

## Hacking the design
The files are open and unlocked, instructions about styling are in the read-me<br />
The rounded corners are a trick which will not work so well on a different colour header, I leave you to figure it out and amend or remove as required<br />
I recommend using this to get used to the new Layout Objects inspector panel

## Issues
Please use the issues tab to report any issues you may find
