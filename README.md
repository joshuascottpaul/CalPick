# CalPick
Card Window date picker for FileMaker solutions

## Required
FileMaker Pro 16 or above

## Installation
Download both files, open Card-Cal and follow read-me instructions

## Hosting
The CardDatePicker file can be hosted so it can be available to all you solutions if required, make sure you edit scripts as outlined in the read-me

## Running
See example scripts in Card-Cal file<br />
Has some beauty on iOS as the layout doesn't move like when using the native picker<br />
Not currently tested on WebDirect

## Hacking the design
The files are open and unlocked, instructions about styling are in the read-me<br />
The rounded corners are a trick which will not work so well on a different colour header, I leave you to figure it out and amend or remove as required

## Issues
